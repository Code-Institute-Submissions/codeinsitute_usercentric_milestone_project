Note: PaddyOS is a fictional computer operative system. The aim of this project is to promote this software to the end user. 


# Official Website for PaddyOS

Official Website for PaddyOS

## What is PaddyOS?

PaddyOS is a robust and reliable operative system based on Linux for everyone, featuring:
* No-nonsense and easy to learn UI with everything right where you need. We don't use "bloatware" or other nuisances.
* PaddyOS is free to install, as we beleive that everyone should have access to a reliable system without costs and control. The Computer is yours, why should you pay or be tracked by adds?

 
## UX

### Strategy and Initial Stage of my Project

A medium was sought to promote a new operative system created by a pioneering group of Irish developers. This medium must be available 24/7 to potential international consumers.

I have concluded that the easiest way to share software is via the Internet. Therefore I've researched several websites of other popular and non-popular operative systems, including:
- Windows 10 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/windows/get-windows-10)
- Ubuntu (https://ubuntu.com/)
- Manjaro (https://manjaro.org/)
- Linux Mint (https://linuxmint.com/)


### Scope of this Project

* The simplest form of promoting PaddyOS on the web requires HTML + CSS as core technologies for a static website
* Website must be available 24/7, so decision has been made to deploy to Github and Gitpages (see Deployment section for more details)
* 3 sections are required, so I've chosen the following:
    * Introduction (showcasing the "What is" and "Why use this")
    * Download (Access to download PaddyOS)
    * Contact Form (ability to contact us for getting involved and feedback)

### Structure

As visitors to website may or not be competent in computer driving, decision was made to organize the website as a single site where user can scroll trough sections.

I've decided to include a main menu, so users can quickly navigate to their prefered section.


### Skeleton

To be faithful to the structure established above, the overall website should be divided in 3 section as shown below:

To avoid a lenghty readme file, please visit [Wireframing Project PaddyOS Website](https://codeinstitute.net) for further study into the skeleton of the website.


### Surface Design

To emphasize project being led by developers in Ireland, decision has been made to include a color scheme based on the green color as per below:
* Main Color: <span style="color:#F3F0F1;background-color:#5C7D61;">#5C7D61</span>
* Main ("white") background/font: <span style="color:#5C7D61;background-color:#F3F0F1;">#F3F0F1</span>
* Dark Shades: <span style="color:#F3F0F1;background-color:#122D23;">#122D23</span>
* Slightly lighter accent from main color: <span style="color:#F3F0F1;background-color:#8DB49E;">#8DB49E</span>
* Slightly darker accent from main color: <span style="color:#F3F0F1;background-color:#7B9E8C;">#7B9E8C</span>

Note that fonts and main "white" background is not exacly white but an easier to the eyes color #F3F0F1.

Logo: Every product/brand should have a logo, so I've created a quick logo based on color #27cc9d which would showcase a balanced shape and caos in form of lines:

### Acknowledgements

- I'm a big fan of Linux and open source colaboration. My inspiration came from the great work on desktop Linux by project like Ubuntu (https://ubuntu.com/), Manjaro (https://manjaro.org/) and Debian (https://linuxmint.com/)

Mentor Feedback:
Stick to 3-4 sections
Idea is novel
Requirement to showcase wireframes (not mockups) / use balsamic
Requirement of planes of UX and write on readme
Contact form and validation is required and requires something saying thank you (bootstrap modal?, open new page?)
- Dont overdo it
How to run locally explanation (how to git clone and double click html) 
testing (tools, how to test, screenshots? gif?)


Tablet
Mobile
Desktop
